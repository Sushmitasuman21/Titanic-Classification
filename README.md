# Titanic-Classification
Titanic Classification : Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.


I had to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.
Firstly, I used dataset from Kaggle for the same and used Jupyter notebook to classify the data using python techniques. I made graphs and charts representing the survival of passengers and also compared the different classification models.


**To build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic, we'll follow these steps:**


**Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset, check for missing values, and explore the features.


**Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and create new features if necessary.


**Feature Selection:** Select relevant features for building the model.


**Model Building:** Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm and train the model.


**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.


**Visualization:** Plot graphs to visualize various aspects of the data and model performance.
