# Titanic-Classification
Titanic Classification : Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.


I had to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.
Firstly, I used dataset from Kaggle for the same and used Jupyter notebook to classify the data using python techniques. I made graphs and charts representing the survival of passengers and also compared the different classification models.
